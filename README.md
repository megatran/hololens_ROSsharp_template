# Project Template for Hololens_ROSsharp

Inspired by [Unity3D](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/tree/master/Unity3D) and [UWP ROS#](https://github.com/dwhit/ros-sharp).

When I followed the UWP ROS# tutorial, I realized there were various steps needed to properly configure the project. Some minor details that were not mentioned by the author led to a couple compiling errors. To save time, I set up this project template that you can just open in Unity 2018 and start tinkering!

## To use this template:
- Open it in Unity 2018.2 or above (make sure the Player setting has NET 4.x or above).
- HoloLens Toolkit 2017 (asset already imported): https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases
